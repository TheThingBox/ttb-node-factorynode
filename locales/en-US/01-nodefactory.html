  <p>Add instance node into your workspace.</p>
  <p>You need to pass to <b>msg.payload</b> an object or an array of node
  descriptions.</p>
  <p>The factory create node id if needed. It adds to node position or workspace
  if needed too. You can add wires.</p>
  <p>The factory not create nodes if the id already exists in the
  <b>flows.json</b>.</p>
  <p>The node appears into all clients open. But it is not deployed. The user
  has to deploy it if he wants to used it.</p>

  <p>For example:</p>
  <pre>
// just one node !
// create a mqtt in node
msg.payload = {
  "type": "mqtt in",
  "name": "My generated node",
  "topic": "wonderful/topic",
  "broker": "my mqtt broker id"
}
// two nodes linked each other: a mqtt in to a mqtt out
// you can create your own ids
// and choose the position in the workspace
msg.payload = [
  {
    "id": "cool",
    "type": "mqtt in",
    "name": "Cool",
    "topic": "cool",
    "broker": "my mqtt broker id",
    "wires": [["fun"]]
  },
  {
    "id": "fun",
    "type": "mqtt out",
    "name": "Fun",
    "topic": "fun",
    "broker": "my mqtt broker id",
    "x": 300,
    "y": 40
  }
]
// you can choose your workspace too
msg.payload = {
  "type": "mqtt in",
  "name": "My generated node",
  "topic": "wonderful/topic",
  "broker": "my mqtt broker id",
  "z": "my workspace id"
}</pre>
